# ArcHud2

ArcHUD displays smooth arcs around your character in the middle of the screen to inform you about the health and power (mana, rage, ...) of you, your pet, and your target.

## About this repository

This is a mirror of the final release of ArcHUD2, which is the last version that works on Vanilla WoW 1.12. It is *not* compatible with Classic or Retail; for that, see [ArcHUD3](https://github.com/nyyr/ArcHUD3).

## Installation
1. Download code (green **Code** button > **Download ZIP**)
2. Extract to Interface\Addons
3. Rename the folder to **ArcHUD2** (with a space)

(Or just use [GitAddonsManager](https://woblight.gitlab.io/overview/gitaddonsmanager/))
